## Tools
I recommend using VSCode on a PC with a few extensions like TypeScript, Eslint and Prettier, which will ensure maxium integration with our code. 

You can also write code in [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@leon332157/repl-it-electron) however is not recommended since it's not optimal for electron. 
## Scripts

### `start`

Runs `npm run build` and `npm run build:run`, used for running electron with compiled ts files in a devlopmemt enviroment. 

### `lint:check`

Identifies all linting issues with eslint. Lints TypeScript as well as JavaScript.

### `lint`

This formats code according to Prettier style guides. Use `npm run lint` to correct all correctable errors.

### `build`

Uses gulp to create a JavaScript build of the app.

### `build:run`

Run electron from ts-out

### `build:prod`
Builds a production JS version of the app.

### `watchDev`
Watch for changes in src and rebuild and relauncher electron every time if there's a change. 

### `dist`
Builds the app for release.
