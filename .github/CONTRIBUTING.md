## Tools
We recommend using the following tools:

+ VSCode as your **IDE**.
+ Git Bash or GitHub Desktop as your **Version Control**.
+ TypeScript, Eslint and Prettier as your VSC **extensions**.

You can also write code in [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@leon332157/repl-it-electron) however it is not recommended since it's not optimal for electron.

## Scripts

These are the scripts that can be run with `npm {script-name}`:
